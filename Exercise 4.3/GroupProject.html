<h1> Group Project </h1>
<p>
The conventional wisdom is that the United States has become more politically divided in the past 5
years. The project will attempt to quantify and demonstrate this increased political divide. The
approach will be a comparative analysis of data gathered in 2015 and 2020 that makes use of a variety
of data visualization techniques. The datasets will be cleaned and filtered for responses of interest
(demographic, geographic and political affiliation) and exported to .csv file format to be consumed by
data visualization libraries.
<br><br>
The data is a pair of surveys conducted in 2015 and 2020 by the Pew Research Center. Each
survey contains demographic, geographic and political/ideology affiliation question. The dataset from
2015 contains 4787 response sets, while the 2020 dataset contains 1504 response sets. These data sets
should be large enough for the task being attempted. The project may not limit itself to these 2
datasets and may add more datasets, especially if earlier useful datasets can be found.
<br><br>
The objective will be to explore the increase in political divide by showing an increase in political
affiliation (bar graph). Since the datasets contain demographic and geographic data for the respondents
it will be possible to show where this divide has become more apparent (map) and in which
demographic groups (sex, age, race, income, etc.) this increase has been most pronounced.
<br><br>
The final goal will a data visualization platform that explores the change in political divide in the
United States since 2015. It will accomplish this making use data visualization objects. These objects
include (but not limited to) scatterplots, bar graphs and maps.
