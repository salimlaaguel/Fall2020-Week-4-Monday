            <p>I will be doing a project on house prices in the Boston neighborhoods. For this project, I will be using the Zillow dataset for Boston home prices & values. The dataset includes 31 neighborhoods in the Boston area with the average home price in that area for each month from September 2007 to August 2017. The reason I picked this time period is that it is interesting to see what happened during the 2007-2008 economic crisis and how the economy recovered afterward. I am planning on making an interactive map to show the prices for a certain time. I am also looking to make a dynamic data visualization graph either through a video or something similar that shows the change over time of the average home prices on each of the neighborhoods. I will manage the data using the pandas library similar to how we have done in the class activities and use Folium Chloropleth to make the interactive map. For the dynamic visualization of the home values over time I am still exploring ways to accomplish this as there are many resources to research.</p>

            <p>The conventional wisdom is that the United States has become more politically divided in the past 5
years. The project will attempt to quantify and demonstrate this increased political divide. The
approach will be a comparative analysis of data gathered in 2015 and 2020 that makes use of a variety
of data visualization techniques. The datasets will be cleaned and filtered for responses of interest
(demographic, geographic and political affiliation) and exported to .csv file format to be consumed by
data visualization libraries.</p>
